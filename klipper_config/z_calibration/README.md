# Sample Configuration

This are some parts of my V2 300 configurations describing all the mag-probe, probing
and QGL stuff.

These configurations are the essence of the overall configuration from
[zellneralex](https://github.com/zellneralex/klipper_config/tree/master)
which is really well done !! Have a look if you want to take all of it!

**CAUTION: Please, don't just copy it - understand and adapt for your needs instead!
Use this on your own risk!**
